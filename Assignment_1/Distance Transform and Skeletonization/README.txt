To run the algorithms please simply open MATLAB and run DIST_TRANSFORM_and_SKELETONIZATION.m file.

There are two different images for testing. Initially, the Facebook logo is chosen. If desired to change, 
please uncomment line 4 to see results for rectangle with rounded corners.

The results are shown for unnormalized, normalized and skeletonization algorithms.
